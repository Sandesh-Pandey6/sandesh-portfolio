            I&apos;m Sandesh Pandey, a passionate web developer based in Nepal. I
            love creating intuitive, performant, and visually appealing web
            applications that solve real problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in web development started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            and I&apos;ve since expanded my skills to include modern frameworks like
            React and Next.js. I enjoy working with Tailwind CSS for rapid,
            utility-first styling and Git for version control.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m constantly learning and exploring new technologies. My goal is
            to grow as a frontend and full-stack developer, building scalable
            applications that make a positive impact.
